# Can i give you link you can analyze it and then give me prompt to build that kind of website using components:

[https://architjain.me/](https://architjain.me/)

Yes, you can absolutely do that, and the site you linked is a good reference for a clean, component-based portfolio.[^1][^2][^3]

Here is a ready-to-use prompt you can paste into Replit AI to get a **similar-style** portfolio built with reusable components (not a copy, just inspired by the layout and feel):

***

You are an expert React front-end engineer.
Build a **single-page developer portfolio** inspired by a modern minimal portfolio like architjain.me, but do not copy any code, text, or assets. Use only original content and styling.

**Tech \& setup**

- Use **React** with functional components and hooks.
- Use **TypeScript (optional, if easier keep JS)** and a modern bundler (Vite or CRA).
- Use a **responsive layout** with a clean, minimal look, light typography, and strong emphasis on sections and spacing.
- Organize the app into clearly separated, reusable components.

**Overall layout**

Create these components and sections:

1. `Navbar`
    - Left: developer name and small role tag (e.g., “MERN Stack Developer”).
    - Right: smooth-scroll links to sections: “About”, “Experience”, “Projects”, “Skills”, “Contact”.
    - Sticky at top with subtle blur or background change on scroll.
2. `HeroSection`
    - Centered or left-aligned main intro section with:
        - Heading like “Hi, I’m [Your Name]”.
        - Subheading like “MERN Stack Developer” with short one-line description.
        - Two primary CTAs: “View Projects” and “Download Resume”.
        - Small secondary line showing current role/status and maybe location.
    - Add subtle motion/transition (text fade-in, slight translate on load).
3. `AboutSection`
    - Brief paragraph about the developer, tech focus (MERN), and interests.
    - A small list of highlight bullets (e.g., years of experience, main specialties, types of projects).
    - Use a simple, clean two-column layout on desktop and stack on mobile.
4. `ExperienceSection`
    - Timeline or stacked cards for experience entries.
    - Each entry: role, company, duration, and 2–3 bullet points.
    - For now, seed with one role: “MERN Stack Developer” with “1 year” duration and placeholder company and responsibilities.
5. `ProjectsSection`
    - Grid or cards-based layout for projects (3–8 items).
    - Each project card:
        - Title.
        - Short description (1–2 lines).
        - Tech stack badges (MongoDB, Express, React, Node, etc.).
        - Links for “Live Demo” and “GitHub”.
    - Add hover effects (e.g., lift, shadow, slight scale).
6. `SkillsSection`
    - Categorized skills similar to a modern developer portfolio:
        - “Frontend” (React, Redux, Tailwind, etc.),
        - “Backend” (Node, Express, MongoDB, etc.),
        - “Tools \& Others” (Git, Docker, etc.).
    - Display as pill badges or grouped columns.
7. `ContactSection`
    - Short text inviting contact from recruiters/clients.
    - Simple contact section with:
        - Email link button.
        - Buttons/icons for GitHub and LinkedIn.
    - Optional simple form (name, email, message) with client-side validation only and a fake “Message sent (demo)” success state.
8. `Footer`
    - Minimal footer with name, year, and small set of links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Email).

**Components \& structure**

Create a clean components folder structure:

- `components/Navbar.tsx`
- `components/HeroSection.tsx`
- `components/AboutSection.tsx`
- `components/ExperienceSection.tsx`
- `components/ProjectsSection.tsx`
- `components/SkillsSection.tsx`
- `components/ContactSection.tsx`
- `components/Footer.tsx`

Also create a `data` file (e.g., `src/data/portfolioData.ts`) where all content is stored as arrays/objects:

- `projects` array (title, description, techStack, liveUrl, githubUrl).
- `experience` array (role, company, startDate, endDate, bullets).
- `skills` grouped by category.

Map all sections from this data so it is easy to replace later.

**Styling**

- Use a modern UI feel:
    - Dark or dark-on-slate background with good contrast, or a subtle gradient background.
    - Clean font pairing (e.g., sans-serif for headings and body).
    - Consistent spacing, shadow, and border-radius scale across components.
- Ensure full responsiveness:
    - Mobile-first design.
    - Stack sections vertically and adjust padding on small screens.
- Add smooth scroll for nav links and small transitions on hover/focus.

**Accessibility \& polish**

- Use semantic HTML (section, nav, main, footer).
- Add `aria-label`s where appropriate and ensure focus states are visible.
- Keep colors accessible (sufficient contrast).

**Placeholders**

Use generic placeholder content but clearly comment where to plug in my details:

- Name, title, location.
- 3–6 real projects.
- 1 year MERN experience entry.
- Skills list tailored to MERN and related tools.
- Links for GitHub, LinkedIn, and email.

Produce all necessary files and code so the project runs immediately in Replit.

***

You can now paste this into Replit AI and then replace the placeholder text/data with your own MERN projects, 3 certifications, and experience.
