You are an expert full-stack web developer. Build a personal portfolio website for a MERN stack developer in the style of Netflix’s web UI, but without using any Netflix trademarks, logos, or copyrighted images. Use only original assets, icons, and text.

Goal

Create a single-page React app (you can use Vite or CRA) that looks and feels like Netflix’s home screen: dark cinematic theme, hero banner at the top, and horizontal carousels of “cards” for my projects, certifications, and experience.

Tech & structure

Use React with modern functional components and hooks.

Use responsive CSS (Flexbox and Grid) with a global dark theme similar to Netflix: deep dark background, subtle gradients, and accent red buttons.

Use clean, reusable components (e.g., Navbar, HeroSection, Row, Card, Footer).

No backend is required for now; hard-code data in a separate data.js file and map over it.

Layout details (Netflix style)

Navbar

Left side: a custom text logo like “DevFlix” styled similarly to Netflix but clearly not using their logo.

Right side: navigation links – “Home”, “Projects”, “Certifications”, “Experience”, “Contact”.

Sticky at the top with a transparent-to-solid background on scroll.

Hero section

Full-width hero at the top with:

Background image or gradient (no Netflix images).

Title text like “MERN Stack Developer” and my name (use placeholders for now).

Short tagline about building full-stack applications.

Two CTA buttons styled like Netflix: a main red button (e.g., “View Projects”) and a secondary ghost button (e.g., “Download Resume”).

Content rows (carousels)

Multiple horizontal rows, each like a Netflix row:

Row 1: “Featured Projects” – cards for 4–8 projects.

Row 2: “All Projects” – more project cards.

Row 3: “Certifications” – cards showing certificate name, org, date, and a “View Credential” button.

Row 4: “Experience” – cards for roles, company, duration, and short description.

Each row has a title on the left and a small description underneath.

Cards should have hover effects (scale up slightly, show extra info on hover).

Cards content (use placeholders)

For projects, each card should include:

Project title.

Short description (2–3 lines).

Tech stack badges (e.g., MongoDB, Express, React, Node).

Buttons/links for “Live Demo” and “GitHub Repo”.

For certifications, each card should include:

Certification title.

Issuing organization.

Date earned.

Optional “Verify” link.

For experience, each card should include:

Job title (e.g., “MERN Stack Developer”).

Company name.

Duration (e.g., “1 year”).

Bullet summary of responsibilities.

Contact section

A section near the bottom with:

Short text inviting recruiters or clients to contact.

A simple contact form with name, email, and message fields.

For now, just validate on the client and show a “Message sent (demo only)” toast or inline message when submitting. No backend.

Footer

Dark footer like Netflix: multiple small link groups (About, Contact, GitHub, LinkedIn).

Centered copyright text.

Behavior and polish

Fully responsive: looks good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Smooth hover transitions and subtle animations (e.g., fade-in rows on scroll).

Implement keyboard navigation and basic accessibility (aria labels for major sections and buttons).

Organize components and styles clearly so that I can easily replace placeholder data with my real projects, 3 certifications, and 1 year of experience.

Deliverables

Set up the full React project in Replit.

Implement all components and styling.

Populate data.js with clear placeholder entries for:

At least 8 projects.

3 certifications.

1 experience entry with “1 year” duration.

Include clear comments showing where to replace:

My name.

Project details.

Certification details.

Experience details.

Contact links (GitHub, LinkedIn, email).

If anything is ambiguous, choose defaults that best mimic a modern Netflix-like portfolio while avoiding any direct copying of Netflix’s exact branding or assets.
